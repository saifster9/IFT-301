			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>During March 1941, some citizens of Mesa, Arizona, were actively working on obtaining a U.S. Army Air Corps facility located near their city. One of the sites seriously considered for the new airfield was on the Gila River Indian Reservation located near Chandler, Arizona. At the time, the land on which Williams would eventually be built was vacant and not used for agriculture due to a lack of irrigation. It had no homes or farms and was essentially desert with a few Indian ruins scattered on it. On their own initiative, the city of Mesa began to acquire rights to the property that was divided among 33 different owners. Agreements were made for a railroad spur line, along with the appropriate electric, water, telephone and gas services.</p>
			<p>The hard work paid off with the announcement in June 1941 that the War Department had approved the site for an Army Air Corps base. Construction of the new base started on 16 July 1941 with a ceremony attended by Mesa, Arizona, mayor George Nicholas Goodman and Arizona governor Sidney P. Osborn, who both attended the groundbreaking of Falcon Field that morning.[1] Initial construction was completed in December, making the base operational.</p>
			<p><img src="lt_williams.jpg" alt="Lt. Charles Williams">As of 10 December, the airfield had no name and a debate ensued on what to call the new base. It was initially named Mesa Military Airport. the name was changed October 1941 to Higley Field, the base being in the proximity of the town of Higley, Arizona. In February 1942, the growing military airfield's name was changed to Williams Field in honor of Arizona native 1st Lt Charles Linton Williams (1898–1927). Lieutenant Williams died on 6 July 1927 when his Boeing PW-9A pursuit aircraft crashed near Fort DeRussy, Hawaii.</p>
			<p>As a flying school, numerous runways and auxiliary airfields were constructed. The main airfield consisted of three concrete 6,000 ft (1,800 m) runways aligned NE/SW, ENE/WSW and NE/SW. A blacktop landing area 5,500 ft × 1,430 ft (1,680 m × 440 m) was aligned E/W to the south of the main field and a 4,100 ft × 1,350 ft (1,250 m × 410 m) blacktop landing area was aligned E/W to the south of the main field.</p>

					<h2>Flagpole</h2>
					<p><img src="flagpole.jpg" alt="Flagpole">The Flagpole is historically significant as an object for its important symbolic and traditional associations with the origins and history of Williams Air Force Base and for its location as a focal point of the major axis of the base plan. Built of a standard military design, the Flagpole design and setting at one end of the former parade ground, clearly conveys its military origin and visually provides an associative link to the early development of the base.</p>
					<p>The flagpole was once located at 10 St. between D and E Sts. at Williams Air Force Base. It is now located at the entrance of the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport which is located on the grounds which once belonged to Williams AFB.</p>
					<p>GPS Location: 33°18′25″N 111°40′45″W</p>
					<p>The flagpole was erected in 1941 by Del E. Webb Construction Company.</p>
